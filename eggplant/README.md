# eggplant

This subdirectory contains the files necessary to run the `eggplant` tutorial.
There's a single notebook (found in the folder `notebooks`) that outlines the
analysis of two different data sets: (i) the developmental heart and (ii) the
mouse brain (with different perturbations).

To run the `eggplant` tutorial, use the associated conda environment provided by
the instructors (also found in the `conda` folder).
